# KFC.com CLONE
This is a clone I made of kfc.com.

Coded using only HTML, CSS, and Javascript without the use of any plug-ins, libraries, or frameworks.

Also implements the Google Maps API in combination with the Google Places API, the Google Geocoding API, and custom javascript to clone the store locator section of the website.
